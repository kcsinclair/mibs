       DESCRIPTION
            "This data type is used as the syntax of the
             gmplsTunnelLSPEncoding object in the definition of
             GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB's gmplsTunnelTable.

             gmplsTunnelLSPEncoding is used to represent and control
             the LSP encoding type of an LSP signaled by a GMPLS
             signaling protocol.

             This textual convention is strongly tied to the LSP
             Encoding Types sub-registry of the GMPLS Signaling
             Parameters registry managed by IANA. Values should be
             assigned by IANA in step with the LSP Encoding Types
             sub-registry and using the same registry management rules.
             However, the actual values used in this textual convention
             are solely within the purview of IANA and do not
             necessarily match the values in the values in the LSP
             Encoding Types sub-registry.

             The definition of this textual convention with the
             addition of newly assigned values is published
             periodically by the IANA, in either the Assigned
