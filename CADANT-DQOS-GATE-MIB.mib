-- Reserved Flow Specification
--
-- The Reserved flow specification describes the envelope that the
-- data flow is currently reserving.
--
-- Flow specifications are composed of a 'TSpec' and an 'RSpec'.
--
-- A Traffic Specification, or TSpec, is a description of the traffic
-- pattern for which service is being requested. In general, the TSpec
-- forms one side of a contract between the data flow and the service.
-- Once a service request is accepted, the service module has agreed to
-- provide a specific QoS as long as the flow's data traffic continues
-- to be accurately described by the TSpec.
--
-- A service accepting an invocation request may be thought of as
-- entering into a contract to provide the service described by the
-- RSpec as long as the flow's traffic continues to be described by the
-- TSpec.

-- Authorized Flow Specification Table
--
-- Flow specifications are composed of a 'TSpec' and an 'RSpec'.
--
-- A Traffic Specification, or TSpec, is a description of the traffic
-- pattern for which service is being requested. In general, the TSpec
-- forms one side of a contract between the data flow and the service.
-- Once a service request is accepted, the service module has agreed to
-- provide a specific QoS as long as the flow's data traffic continues
-- to be accurately described by the TSpec.
--
-- A service accepting an invocation request may be thought of as
-- entering into a contract to provide the service described by the
-- RSpec as long as the flow's traffic continues to be described by the
-- TSpec.
