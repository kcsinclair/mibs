     MAX-ACCESS  read-create
     STATUS      current
     DESCRIPTION "When non-persistent AROs are in use, DC-BGP breaks up the
                  processing and reduces the peak occupancy requirements by
                  splitting the Adj-RIB-Outs into a number of processing
                  groups.  The number of AROs in a group is controlled by
                  bgpRmEntNumArosInGroup.  This field is used to specify the
                  maximum number of such groups permitted to contain fully
                  populated AROs.

                  Each group is processed to completion including the
                  transmission of required UPDATEs to peers.  Processing to
                  completion allows the routes in a group to be freed
                  before moving onto the next group thus limiting peak
                  occupancy.  A group is blocked if one or more of its member
                  Adj-RIB-Outs are subject to flow control.  If
                  bgpRmEntMaxActiveAroGroups are blocked then DC-BGP will
                  itself be blocked until a group is unblocked.  Setting a
                  high value for the number of groups decreases the chance of
                  DC-BGP being blocked but increases peak occupancy.

                 updates.

                 Note that setting bgpRmEntUpdateGroups to 'true' requires
                 that all of the peers in each IBGP peer group are
                 configured such that they require the same set of routes.
                 This imposes a number of configuration restrictions.

                 does not match the value for a peer in the peer group's

                 The following timer values will be taken from an arbitrary
                 member of the update group and will be applied to the
                 whole update group.  The timer values will therefore be
                 deterministic only if the same values are used for all
                 peers in a peer group.

                 -  bgpPeerMinASOriginationInterval.

                 The local IP address used for next-hop-self will be taken
                 from an arbitrary member of the update group and will be
                 applied to the whole update group.  The local IP address
                 used will therefore be deterministic only if the same
                 values are used for all peers in a peer group.

                 Note also that setting bgpRmEntUpdateGroups to 'true'
                 limits the use of ORF (Outbound Route Filtering) for the
                 peers in an update group.  In particular, DC-BGP will

                 - Routes are stored in this way, even if the peer advertizes
                   support for RR or ORF.
                 - Route refresh and ORF capabilities continue to be advertized

                   one (containing no ORFs) at the start of the session if
                   both peers support ORF.

    DESCRIPTION "The number of instances of the local AS identifier that may
                 be contained in the route's AS-Path without rejecting the

                 The AS-Path attribute of a BGP route contains the identifiers
                 of the Autonomous Systems traversed by the route.  When
                 a route is received with an AS-Path containing the local
                 AS identifier, it normally indicates a routing loop, and
                 the default behavior is to reject the route.  This object
                 allows this behavior to be over-ridden.

                 This is useful, for example, for VPN routes, where routes
                 from one CE router are advertised to other CE routers
                 through a provider's BGP network.  Two CE routers in
                 the same AS can enable this feature to prevent routes from
                 the other CE from being discarded.

                 When bgpPeerAllowLocalAs is set to a non-zero value, that
                 value is used for all address families, and the value of

                 Alternatively, the value may be configured independently for
                 each address family.  To do this, set bgpPeerAllowLocalAs to 0
                 and set the value of bgpPeerAfiSafiAllowLocalAs for each
                 address family.

                 By default, BGP performs sender side loop detection.
                 That is, it will not advertise a route to a peer if
                 the AS-Path of the route already contains the peer's AS
                 number.  A peer would typically discard such routes, so
                 this is normally a useful optimization.

                 However, the peer may be configured to accept such routes
                 (see bgpPeerAllowLocalAs).  In this case it is
                 necessary to disable sender-side loop detection, by setting
                 bgpPeerDisableSndLpDetect to 'true'.

                 Sender-side loop detection may be disabled independently

                 The AS-Path attribute of a BGP route contains the identifiers
                 of the Autonomous Systems traversed by the route.  When
                 a route is received with an AS-Path containing the local
                 AS identifier, it normally indicates a routing loop, and
                 the default behavior is to reject the route.  This object
                 allows this behavior to be over-ridden.

                 This is useful, for example, for VPN routes, where routes
                 from one CE router are advertised to other CE routers sites
                 through a provider's BGP network.  Two CE routers in
                 the same AS can enable this feature to prevent routes from
                 the other CE from being discarded.

                 configuration provided by bgpPeerDisableSenderLoopDetect.

                 By default, BGP performs sender side loop detection.  That
                 is, it will not advertise a route to a peer if the AS-Path
                 of the route already contains the peer's AS number.  A
                 peer would typically discard such routes, so this is
                 normally a useful optimization.

                 However, the peer may be configured to accept such routes
                 (see bgpPeerAfiSafiAllowLocalAs).  In this case it is
                 necessary to disable sender-side loop detection.

                 When bgpPeerDisableSenderLoopDetect is 'true', BGP
                 disables sender-side loop detection for those address

    DESCRIPTION "Indicates whether BGP should originate a default route to
                 the peer for this address family.

                 BGP cannot originate default VPN routes and so
                 bgpPeerAfiSafiOrigDefault cannot be set to 'true' if
                 bgpPeerAfiSafiSafi is 'mplsBgpVpn'.

                 This is because there is no single default route for a VPN
                 address family - there may be one for each VRF.  If a
                 default VPN route is required, it should should be
                 redistributed from the corresponding VRF.  This ensures
                 that the default VPN route is advertised by BGP along with
                 the associated label, route distinguisher and route
                 targets.

                 Similarly, BGP does not support the allocation of a label
                 for a default route, and so bgpPeerAfiSafiOrigDefault
                 cannot be set to 'true' if bgpPeerAfiSafiSafi is
                 'labeled'.

                 Default routes are meaningless for L2VPN auto-discovery
                 and signaling, so bgpPeerAfiSafiOrigDefault cannot be set
                 to 'true' if bgpPeerAfiSafiAfi is 'l2vpn'.

                 The origination of default routes may optionally be
                 conditional based on policy.  If this is required, then
                 set bgpPeerAfiSafiOrigDefaultRtMap to specify a route map.

                 If no route map is specified
                 (bgpPeerAfiSafiOrigDefaultRtMap is zero), then default
                 route origination is based solely on the setting of
                 bgpPeerAfiSafiOrigDefault."

                 bgpRouteMapTable with bgpRouteMapIndex set to
                 bgpPeerAfiSafiOrigDefaultRtMap.

                 The route map has two purposes.

                - The match clauses are used for conditional advertisement
                  of the default route.  A default route is only originated
                  for an address family if bgpPeerAfiSafiOrigDefault
                  is 'true' and if there is at least one route in the loc-RIB
                  matching the route map.

                - The set clauses of the route map determine the attributes
                  of the originated default route.

                 Note that route maps may consist of multiple bgpRouteMapTable
                 entries.  These bgpRouteMapTable entries can be configured
                 to match a specific address family.  Any such bgpRouteMapTable
                 entry that does not match the address family for this
                 bgpPeerAfiSafiTable entry is ignored.

                 These route maps should be configured as follows.

                - To restrict a route map to a particular AFI/SAFI, specify
                  bgpRouteMapMaAfi and bgpRouteMapMaSafi.

                - Each route map should specify an IP prefix list to match
                  on.  This is not mandated by DC-BGP, but other types of
                  matches may have a performance impact.

                - Each IP prefix match is assumed to be an exact match.  In
                  other words, DC-BGP treats each bgpIpPreTable entry as
                  having bgpIpPreLe = bgpIpPreLen, and bgpIpPreGe = 0."

-- All Policy tables are DC-BGP specific.  When configuring one row to

-- referred to row cannot be deactivated if it is the last in the map, and
-- the referring row is still present.  The referred to row can also not

-- DC-BGP Route Map Table

-- This table is used to create and manage DC-BGP route maps.  Route Maps are
-- the centre of DC-BGP policy formation and essentially form a filter.  A row
-- in this table cannot be destroyed if there is a SET pending for any of the
-- associated list tables (AS path lists, (extended) community lists, ip prefix
-- lists).
--
-- Certain restrictions apply to an entry in this table if it represents one or
-- more ORFs.  If the ORF association is remote then the entry has been created
-- as a result of advertisements from a peer in which case all fields are
-- read-only.
--
-- If the ORF association is local then the entry represents ORF information to
-- be advertised to peers in which case the following applies:
--
-- The MaAfi and MaSafi fields MUST be assigned.
-- The MaComm, MaExtCom, MaAddr and Continue fields are the only other fields
-- that may be specified.  All other fields are deemed inconsistent.

    DESCRIPTION "This object is used in conjunction with
                 bgpPeergrAfiSafiSoftResetStore to configure 'soft reset with
                 stored routing information'.  This option causes all routes
                 learned from peers in the peer group to be stored so that
                 the ARI can be recalculated (for example, due to a change in
                 import policy) without performing a route refresh or
                 restarting the peer session.

                 When bgpPeergrSoftResetWithStoredInfo is 'false', BGP does not
                 perform soft reset for any address family.

                 When bgpPeergrSoftResetWithStoredInfo is 'true', BGP performs
                 soft reset for those address families for which
                 bgpPeergrAfiSafiSoftResetStore is 'true'.

                 There is a significant occupancy impact associated with
                 this option.

                 IMPORTANT: Note that a change to this field does not affect
                 peer sessions that are already underway.  Restarting such
                 sessions will cause the new value to take effect.

                 Note that this option overlaps with route refresh (RR) and
                 Outbound Route Filter (ORF) behavior:  To clarify, when this
                 option is enabled, the following also occur for sessions
                 to peers associated with the peer group.

                 - Routes are stored in this way, even if the peer advertizes
                   support for RR or ORF.
                 - Route refresh and ORF capabilities continue to be advertized
                   (if configured).
                 - A route refresh will never be sent to this peer, apart from
                   one (containing no ORFs) at the start of the session if
                   both peers support ORF.
                 - ORFs are never sent to the peer.
                 - DC-BGP still responds to RR requests from the peer (if it
                   advertizes the RR capability).

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION "The number of instances of the local AS identifier that
                 may be contained in the route's AS-Path without rejecting
                 the route.

                 The AS-Path attribute of a BGP route contains the
                 identifiers of the Autonomous Systems traversed by the
                 route.  When a route is received with an AS-Path
                 containing the local AS identifier, it normally indicates
                 a routing loop, and the default behavior is to reject the
                 route.  This object allows this behavior to be
                 over-ridden.

                 This is useful, for example, for VPN routes, where routes
                 from one CE router are advertised to other CE routers
                 through a provider's BGP network.  Two CE routers in the
                 same AS can enable this feature to prevent routes from the
                 other CE from being discarded.

                 When bgpPeergrAllowLocalAs is set to a non-zero value,
                 that value is used for all address families, and the value
                 of bgpPeergrAfiSafiAllowLocalAs is ignored.

                 Alternatively, the value may be configured independently
                 for each address family.  To do this, set
                 bgpPeergrAllowLocalAs to 0 and set the value of
                 bgpPeergrAfiSafiAllowLocalAs for each address family.

                 Changing the value of this object while the peer is active
                 triggers BGP to refresh its routes from the peer."

                 should disable sender-side loop detection when sending
                 routes to the peer.

                 By default, BGP performs sender side loop detection.  That
                 is, it will not advertise a route to a peer if the AS-Path
                 of the route already contains the peer's AS number.  A
                 peer would typically discard such routes, so this is
                 normally a useful optimization.

                 However, the peer may be configured to accept such routes
                 (see bgpPeergrAllowLocalAs).  In this case it is necessary
                 to disable sender-side loop detection, by setting
                 bgpPeergrDisableSndLpDetect to 'true'.

                 Sender-side loop detection may be disabled independently
                 for each address family.  When bgpPeergrDisableSndLpDetect
                 is set to 'true', set bgpPeergrAfiSafiDisSndLpDetect to
                 'true' or 'false' to disable or enable sender-side loop
                 detection for each address family.

                 If the value is changed while the peer session is active, BGP
                 will check for any routes that need to be advertised or
                 withdrawn as a result of the change."

                 When set to 'false', the error handling mechanism defined
                 in the original BGP specification is used, and the BGP
                 session is reset.  This can lead to session flapping and
                 network instability, even though routing is not adversely
                 affected by the presence of these malformed attributes.

                 When set to 'true', the alternative error handling
                 mechanism of 'attribute discard' is used, where the
                 attribute is dropped and the rest of the BGP UPDATE
                 message is processed as normal.

                 Use of 'attribute discard' error handling is fixed at the
                 start of a BGP session, so changes to this field take
                 effect at the start of the next session."

    DESCRIPTION "This table is used to control how DC-BGP aggregates
                 addresses.  Each entry in the table results in one aggregate
                 address being created.  This will result in an aggregate
                 entry in the routing table when at least one more specific
                 route matching the address specified is learnt.  If the
                 aggregate is marked as 'permanent', then an aggregate entry
                 is created in the routing table even if no more specific
                 matching routes are known.

                 The options allow configuration as to whether the AS_PATH
                 attribute keeps full information or not, and whether the more
                 specfic route is also entered in the routing table (the
                 summary only option).  These options can also be chosen on
                 a per route basis by matching on the advertise and suppress
                 route maps.

                 The attribute route map is used to set attributes of the
                 aggregated route if required.

                 It is possible to create overlapping entries in the table.
                 This can result in routes that match more than one
                 table entry.

                 -  If a route matches multiple aggregate addresses,
                 then it is suppressed any of the matching aggregates would
                 cause the route to be suppressed.

                 -  If a route matches the advertise map of an aggregate
                 address, then it is not aggregated by that aggregate address.

                 The AS-Path attribute of a BGP route contains the identifiers
                 of the Autonomous Systems traversed by the route.  When
                 a route is received with an AS-Path containing the local

                 the default behavior is to reject the route.  This object
                 allows this behavior to be over-ridden.

                 This is useful, for example, for VPN routes, where routes
                 from one CE router are advertised to other CE routers sites
                 through a provider's BGP network.  Two CE routers in
                 the same AS can enable this feature to prevent routes from
                 the other CE from being discarded.

                 By default, BGP performs sender side loop detection.  That
                 is, it will not advertise a route to a peer if the AS-Path
                 of the route already contains the peer's AS number.  A
                 peer would typically discard such routes, so this is
                 normally a useful optimization.

                 However, the peer may be configured to accept such routes
                 (see bgpPeergrAfiSafiAllowLocalAs).  In this case it is
                 necessary to disable sender-side loop detection.

                 When bgpPeergrDisableSenderLoopDetect is 'true', BGP

    DESCRIPTION "Indicates whether BGP should originate a default route to
                 the peer group for this address family.

                 BGP cannot originate default VPN routes and so
                 bgpPeergrAfiSafiOrigDefault cannot be set to 'true' if
                 bgpPeerAfiSafiSafi is 'mplsBgpVpn'.

                 This is because there is no single default route for a VPN
                 address family - there may be one for each VRF.  If a
                 default VPN route is required, it should should be
                 redistributed from the corresponding VRF.  This ensures
                 that the default VPN route is advertised by BGP along with
                 the associated label, route distinguisher and route
                 targets.

                 Similarly, BGP does not support the allocation of a label
                 for a default route, and so bgpPeergrAfiSafiOrigDefault
                 cannot be set to 'true' if bgpPeergrAfiSafiSafi is
                 'labeled'.

                 Default routes are meaningless for L2VPN auto-discovery
                 and signaling, so bgpPeergrAfiSafiOrigDefault cannot be
                 set to 'true' if bgpPeergrAfiSafiAfi is 'l2vpn'.

                 The origination of default routes may optionally be
                 conditional based on policy.  If this is required, then
                 set bgpPeergrAfiSafiOrigDefaultRtMap to specify a route
                 map.

                 If no route map is specified
                 (bgpPeergrAfiSafiOrigDefaultRtMap is zero), then default
                 route origination is based solely on the setting of
                 bgpPeergrAfiSafiOrigDefault."

                 It identifies a route map consisting of all rows in the
                 bgpRouteMapTable with bgpRouteMapIndex set to
                 bgpPeergrAfiSafiOrigDefaultRtMap.

                 The route map has two purposes.

                - The match clauses are used for conditional advertisement
                  of the default route.  A default route is only originated
                  for an address family if bgpPeergrAfiSafiOrigDefault
                  is 'true' and if there is at least one route in the loc-RIB
                  matching the route map.

                - The set clauses of the route map determine the attributes
                  of the originated default route.

                 Note that route maps may consist of multiple bgpRouteMapTable
                 entries.  These bgpRouteMapTable entries can be configured
                 to match a specific address family.  Any such bgpRouteMapTable
                 entry that does not match the address family for this
                 bgpPeergrAfiSafiTable entry is ignored.

                 These route maps should be configured as follows.

                - To restrict a route map to a particular AFI/SAFI, specify
                  bgpRouteMapMaAfi and bgpRouteMapMaSafi.

                - Each route map should specify an IP prefix list to match
                  on.  This is not mandated by DC-BGP, but other types of
                  matches may have a performance impact.

                - Each IP prefix match is assumed to be an exact match.  In
                  other words, DC-BGP treats each bgpIpPreTable entry as
                  having bgpIpPreLe = bgpIpPreLen, and bgpIpPreGe = 0."

                 bgpRmAfiSafiAfmRequired is set to 'true'.  In addition, this
                 option requires that an AFM be configured to inform BGP
                 whenever a route from BGP is successfully installed in the
                 forwarding table, or is removed from the forwarding table.
                 This is achieved by configuring an AFM to redistribute
                 routes from this instance of BGP back to this instance of
                 BGP.

                 Not all AFMs support this redistribution of routes.  For
                 such address families, an attempt to set
                 bgpRmAfiSafiAdvertiseInactive to 'false' will be rejected.
