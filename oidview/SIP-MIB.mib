        DESCRIPTION
                "Initial version of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
                 MIB module.  SIP is an application-layer signalling
                 protocol for creating, modifying and terminating
                 multimedia sessions with one or more participants.
                 These sessions include Internet multimedia conferences
                 and Internet telephone calls.  SIP is defined in
                 RFC 2543 (March 1999).

                 This MIB is defined for the management of SIP User
                 Agents (UAs), Proxy and Redirect Servers, and
                 registrars.

                 A User Agent is an application that contains both a
                 User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).
                 A UAC is an application that initiates a SIP request.
                 A UAS is an application that contacts the user when a
                 SIP request is received and that returns a response on
                 behalf of the user.  The response accepts, rejects, or
                 redirects the request.

                 A Proxy Server acts as both a client and a server.
                 It accepts requests from other clients, either
                 responding to them or passing them on to other
                 servers, possibly after modification.

                 A Redirect Server accepts requests from clients and
                 returns zero or more addresses to that client. Unlike
                 a Proxy server it does not initiate requests.  Unlike
                 a User Agent Server it does not accept calls.

                 A Registrar is a server that accepts REGISTER
                 requests.  A Registrar is typically co-located with a
                 Proxy or Redirect Server.

                 A SIP transaction occurs between a client and a server
                 and comprises all messages from the first request sent
                 from the client to the server up to a final (non-1xx)
                 response sent from the server to the client."

             of SIP, which only provides mechanisms whereby support for
             specific features may be signalled or requested.

             For example, a user agent client may require that a server
             support the 'com.example.billing' feature, which it would
             indicate in a Require header.  Such a client would have

             the string in its sipFtrSupportedTable.

             If a server does not support the required feature
             (indicated in a Require header to a UAS, or in a Proxy-

             Server (ULS) being used to resolve the location of end
             points.

             This could be a Domain Name Server (DNS) or a SIP
             proxy/redirect server in the case where this entity is a
             user agent. This could be some sort of database server if
             this entity is a proxy/redirect server.

             The format of the address follows the IETF service
             location protocol. The syntax is as follows:

                mapping-type:type-specific-syntax

             The mapping-type specifies a scheme for mapping the
             matching dial  string to a target server. The type-
             specific-syntax is exactly that, something that the
             particular mapping scheme can understand.
             For example,
                Session target           Meaning
                ipv4:171.68.13.55:1006   The session target is the IP
                                         version 4 address of
                                         171.68.13.55 and port 1006.
                dns:pots.cisco.com       The session target is the IP
                                         host with dns name
                                         pots.cisco.com.

             The valid Mapping type definitions for the peer are as
             follows:
                ipv4  - Syntax: ipv4:w.x.y.z:port or  ipv4:w.x.y.z
