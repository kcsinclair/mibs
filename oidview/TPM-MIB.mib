    DESCRIPTION
            "This module defines managed objects for measuring traffic
            related transport performance metrics in networks.  In

            monitoring selectable performance metrics and statistics
            derived from the monitoring of network packets and

        preconfigured with those combinations of metrics and

        Implementations must populate the table with all possible
        metric and protocol combinations and have the default

        does not support the creation of new metric and protocol

        metrics and protocol combinations that it can generate.
        Because the probe will only populate this table with supported
        entries, and the table cannot have entries added, the

        If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe
        will not perform computations for this performance metric and

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The type of aggregation being performed for this set of
        reports.

        The metrics for a single traffic flow are selected in the
        perfTable by the tpmReportControlMetrics object.  When such
        metrics are aggregated in this MIB, these metrics are
        replaced by statistical representation of each metric.
        The metrics describing aggregates are constant no matter
        which type of aggregation is being performed. These
        metrics may be found in the tpmReportTable.

        The flows(1) aggregation is the simplest. All traffic
        flows that share common protocol/server/client 3-tuples
        are aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics
        for all such unique 3-tuples.

        The clients(2) aggregation results in somewhat more
        aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All traffic
        flows that share common protocol/client tuples are
        aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for
        all such unique tuples.

        The servers(3) aggregation usually results in still more
        aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All traffic
        flows that share common protocol/server tuples are
        aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for
        all such unique tuples.

        The protocols(4) aggregation results in the most
        aggregation (i.e. the fewest resulting records). All
        traffic flows that share a common protocol are aggregated
        together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
        protocols.

        Note that it is not meaningful to aggregate protocols, as
        different protocols have widely varying characteristics. As a
        result, this set of aggregations is complete.

        tpmReportControlStatus object is equal to active(1)."

        implementation and available resources.

        It is important to note that this value is the number of
        requested entries in the tpmReportTable only.  Since the
        probe can derive this table from the apmReportTable, the probe
        must make sure that sufficient resources exist to support the

        available resources. The probe must not lower this
        value except as a result of a set to the associated
        tpmReportControlRequestedSize object.

        Since the probe must support only the granted size,
        the probe should attempt to maintain the most recently active
        entries in the tpmMetric table if there is no more room
        or until there are no more performance metric entries.

        It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether or not

        based on the requested amount in
        tpmReportControlRequestedReports. Since each report can have
        many entries, the total number of entries allocated will be
        this number multiplied by the value of

        When the associated tpmReportControlRequestedReports object is

        closely to the requested value as is possible for the
        particular implementation and available resources. When
        considering resources available, the agent must consider its
        ability to allocate this many reports each with the number of
        entries represented by tpmReportControlGrantedSize, or 1 if
        that object doesn't exist.

        Note that while the storage required for each report may
        fluctuate due to changing conditions, the agemt must continue
        to have storage available to satisfy the full report size for
        all reports when necessary. Further, the agent must not lower
        this value except as a result of a set to the associated

        This number is valuable in determining if enough entries have
        been allocated for reports in light of fluctuating network
        usage. Note that an entry that is denied will often be
        attempted again, this number will not predict the exact number
        of additional entries needed, but can be used to understand
        the relative magnitude of the problem.

        Also note that there is no ordering specified for the entries
        in the report, thus there are no rules for which entries will
        be omitted when not enough entries are available. As a

        This count does not include packets that were not counted
        because they had MAC-layer errors.

        Note that if the alMatrixTables are not implemented or are
        inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol

        The tpmExceptionReportIndex value in the index identifies which

        The first protocolDirLocalIndex value in the index identifies
        the application protocol that is begin reported.
        The second protocolDirLocalIndex value in the index identifies
        the network layer protocol of the tpmReportServerAddress. When
        the associated tpmReportControlAggregationType value is equal
        to protocol(4), this value will equal 0.

        The tpmExceptionReportMetricIndex value in the index identifies
        the transported application protocol of the traffic flows
