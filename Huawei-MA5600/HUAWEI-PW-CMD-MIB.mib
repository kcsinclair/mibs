-- Description:    Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) is an end-to-end L2 service bearing technology, 
--                 that belongs to L2 VPN in the P2P mode. The system implements the PWE3 architecture through MPLS, by 
--                 using the LDP or RSVP-TE protocol as signaling. Therefore, it can implement the ATM and Ethernet emulation 
--                 services and establish the ATM or Ethernet private lines. Thus, it provides a solution to the emulation private 
--                 line service in the IP network.
